These data were recorded from 37 subjects using the following exclusion
criteria: Normal, or correct to normal, vision; no history of neurological disorder; and less than 35 years of age.

Subjects completed a novel, visual contextual trajectory paradigm (CTP) wherein
the onset of a bound stimulus violated an established trajectory in terms of
its brightness, size, or orientation. No attribute was violated during control
trials. Full method details can be read within the following published paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2023.08.004
