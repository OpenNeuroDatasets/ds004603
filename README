These data were recorded from 37 subjects using the following exclusion
criteria:

Normal, or correct to normal, vision,
No history of neurological disorder, and
Less than 35 years of age.

Subjects completed a novel, visual contextual trajectory paradigm (CTP) wherein
the onset of a bound stimulus violated an established trajectory in terms of
its brightness, size, or orientation. No attribute was violated during control
trials.
